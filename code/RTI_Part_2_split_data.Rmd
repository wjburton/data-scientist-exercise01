###Step 3: Split the data into Training, Validation, and Test sets
  
***
  
```{r}
# set the random seed for reproducibility
set.seed(143)

# Create a vector with 1's 2's and 3's .
# each value has the proportion occurring that is desired
# for the training, validation, and test data splits. 
n <- nrow(records) 
split_number <-  c( rep(1, ceiling( n * 0.7) ), 
                    rep(2, ceiling( n * 0.2) ),
                    rep(3, ceiling( n * 0.1) ) )

# Randomize the Split levels
records$split_number  <- split_number[sample(1:n,n)] # assign random split

  
# save each split to a different object
records %>% 
  filter(split_number == 1) -> train
  
records %>% 
  filter(split_number == 2) -> valid
  
records %>% 
  filter(split_number == 3) -> test
  
  
# write each to a csv
write.csv(train, 'C:/Users/Will/Documents/MSA/jobs/rti_challenge/data-scientist-exercise01/data/train.csv', row.names = F)
write.csv(valid, 'C:/Users/Will/Documents/MSA/jobs/rti_challenge/data-scientist-exercise01/data/valid.csv', row.names = F)
write.csv(test, 'C:/Users/Will/Documents/MSA/jobs/rti_challenge/data-scientist-exercise01/data/test.csv', row.names = F)
